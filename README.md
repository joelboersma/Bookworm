# Project Summary
## Bookworm

This platform facilitates a “yard sale”- for books. Each user will have a wish list that contains books they are searching for, and an inventory list that contains books they have but no longer want. Books can be added to either list by entering ISBN number, book condition (new, used, poor) and, optionally, a picture. The items on each user’s wish list/inventory list will be featured as listings on a general database, which will be able for all users to view. The app will also have a “matches” page, which displays all listings that correspond to the user’s personal wish list and inventory. Filters will be added to allow user to filter these listings by distance, condition, etc. Upon selecting a listing, users will be able to get into contact and arrange the book transaction!

This is the source of all our book information on Post and Request pages, as well as for our two scanners. Utilizing their search API, I worked on the search funcionality on the Post and Request pages, at first only fetching results when the search button is pressed, and then fetching results each time the search bar text is changed. I worked on color-coding items on the Home and Matches pages based on whether whether the item is a listing or a request. I also made some changes for `MatchesEntryViewController` so that it can be dual-purpose for both buying and selling. Boilerplate repository setup, creating the launch screen, minor UI changes, and optimizations round out my project contributions.

For backend, I implemented the contact seller/buyer UI message composer pop up which pulls the buyer/seller's phone number from our realtime database and populates a personalized message using the user's first name and post details. I attempted a partial implementation of matches view, but it wasn't robust and a different implementation made more sense based on the structure of our database. Lastly, I implemented the backend portion of the change location button in profile view, by updating users' ZipCode values in our realtime database as needed.
