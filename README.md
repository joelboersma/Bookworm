# Project Summary
Bookworm - the app that pairs people based on books not looks.
Each person has a wish list and an inventory (a list of books they have but no longer want). Books can be added to either list by entering ISBN number, the variation (ebook, paperback, hardcover), book condition (new, used, poor) and optionally, pictures and additional comments. The app notifies and matches people if an item on one person’s inventory is on someone else’s wish list. Each person is added to the other’s messaging tab and the matched item is listed at the top of their chatbox. The chatboxes will also have a “received” and “transferred” button based on whether the book was on your wish list or on your inventory. If pressed, the pair will automatically unmatch and each party will be asked to confirm the removal of that item from the respective list. This gives them the option to keep the book on their list if they want to acquire/sell another copy. Additionally, users always have the option to manually remove/add books from their list(s). Any matches that depended on the presence of certain books on certain lists will be automatically unmatched upon their removal from said lists. Users also always have the option to unmatch with others for any reason (ex. hostility, unresponsiveness, etc.)
